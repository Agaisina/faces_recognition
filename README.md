To promote and advance the use of synthetic data for face recognition, we organize the second edition of the Face Recognition Challenge in the Era of Synthetic Data (FRCSyn). This challenge intends to explore the application of synthetic data to the field of face recognition in order to find solutions to the current limitations in the technology, for example, in terms of privacy concerns associated with real data, bias in demographic groups (e.g., ethnicity and gender), and lack of performance in challenging conditions such as large age gaps between enrolment and testing, pose variations, occlusions, etc.

This challenge intends to provide an in-depth analysis of the following research questions:

What are the limits of face recognition technology trained only with synthetic data? Can the use of synthetic data be beneficial to reduce the current limitations in face recognition technology? This is a novel and very important research line nowadays due to the recent discontinuation of face recognition datasets due to privacy concerns. Furthermore, state-of-the-art face recognition technology has several limitations in terms of bias in demographic groups (e.g., ethnicity and gender), and lack of performance in challenging conditions such as large age gaps between enrolment and testing, pose variations, occlusions, etc.

Here, we adress Task 2: synthetic data for overall performance improvement (e.g., according to age, pose, expression, occlusion, demographic groups, etc).
